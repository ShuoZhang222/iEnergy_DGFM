# iEnergy_DGFM
This repository is for sharing MATLAB codes for parameter design of the lead-compensator-based DGFM VSC and PLECS simulation files used in the paper, " Analysis and synchronization controller design of dual-port grid-forming voltage-source converters for different operation modes".
MATLAB codes for calculating  control  parameters  of  the  lead-compensator-based DGFM  VSC  and  PLECS  simulation  files  for  the  three  operation modes.
